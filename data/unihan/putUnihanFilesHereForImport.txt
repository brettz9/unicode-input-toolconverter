This file is just for the extension author's purpose of importing Unihan
files into a SQLite database.

This is a place-holder for the large Unihan files which can be put here 
when manually importing Unihan files into the SQLite database via 
/data/unihan-import.xhtml (works in Chrome).

That file will look in this directory and create a CSV file out of the 
different Unihan files which can then be easily imported using 
SQLite Manager.
