# unicode-input-toolconverter

**INCOMPLETE!!**

A web app / restartless Firefox add-on to allow selection of Unicode
characters by a variety of means and conversion between various
Unicode representations such as HTML/XML entities, numeric
character references, etc.

# Todos
* Convert XUL-based add-on to HTML5 (use Jamilih for greater flexibility and i18n)
* Utilize column browser for browsing deep hierarchies such as list of blocks/scripts/categories (also use in filebrowser-enhanced!)
