<ul><b>Changes to 2.6.2b2</b>
<li>Added support for custom protocol:</li>
<li>1) command to find character in chart; use the pattern "x-unicode:?find;char=" in HTML links to trigger the extension </li>

<li>extension opening with your character!</li>
<li>Protocol is not a permanent one, so only use with the understanding that if it is ever standardized, it would change at</li>
<li>least its protocol name and probably the formation of the rest of the query; if you plan to add server-side support,</li>
<li>you should at least store the query components in variables so they can be changed later if it becomes a standard</li>

<li>Fixed CJK Ideograph Extension B to search the Unihan file (though many of these were only made available in a 27MB file not included (see below))</li>

<li>http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip into this "charrefunicode" extension's 'data' folder, but Unihan.txt is now </li>
<li>27MB and is a bit flaky with local Ajax description display (probably since the file is so large), so you still might want to stick with</li>
<li>the old file until such time as I might be able to get it all to work in FF's database)</li>
<li>Localization: Made a few error strings localizable and </li>
<li>added Hungarian changes from Dr. Karoly Fabricz</li>
<li>Minor code improvements</li>
